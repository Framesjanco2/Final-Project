# Final-Project

### Objectives in this project  
- Create alarms with certain thresholds using kibana to monitor a network that we then breached 
- Forcefully gain access to a vulnerable wordpress server by discovering and using exploits  
- Using packet capture software to analyze and find malicious actors in the network  

If you want a detailed explanation with screenshots of what was accomplished with this project, check the [Blue Team](https://github.com/Framesjanco2/Final-Project/blob/main/BlueTeam.md), [Red Team](https://github.com/Framesjanco2/Final-Project/blob/main/RedTeam.md), and [Network Analysis](https://github.com/Framesjanco2/Final-Project/blob/main/NetworkAnalysis.md) files for more information.  

You can also view the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BJh0A5CIYl76XHjgLe1SxQquP_5zgNqkH_rQx2_AOIM/edit?usp=sharing) that my assigned group and I covered which focused more in depth on the red team penetration testing aspect of the project that involved understanding and using exploits to find flags hidden in a wordpress site
